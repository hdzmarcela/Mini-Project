![Chess Opening Diagram](diagram.jpg)

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of chess games from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) to uncover interesting patterns in professional and amateur matches. The analysis focuses on:

- Outcomes of games (White wins, Black wins, Draws)  
- Game length distribution  
- Popular openings and their frequencies  

The goal is **reproducible analysis**: anyone can clone this repo, run the notebook, and reproduce the results.
